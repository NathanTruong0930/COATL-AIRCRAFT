# COATL-AIRCRAFT Week 1 Progress Report
Week 1 Dates: 03/31/2025 - 04/06/2025
Report Date: 04/06/2025


- ## Last Week (Times in Hours)
    - Team Review
        - For our first week, we reconvened and talked about the progress of the PCB
        - Getting code to work on the PCB has been a challenge. The ESP32 on our PCB has not been responding as predicted and we cannot get proper measurements from our PCB circuit
        - We are also working on getting our MAX1032 to respond to our code. Progress has been very uneven
        - An electrode mesh for the tube dust sensor has been selected and we are waiting to talk to Josh about it's viability as an electrode mesh
    - Team Member 1 - Felix Moss
        - Github Updates (2)
        - Mesh research (1)
        - Meeting (4)

        - BOM (2)
        - Meeting (4)
    - Team Member 3 - Nathan Truong
        - Soldering, continuity testing (3)

- ## Next Week
    - Team Plan
        - Ask Josh about physical construction of tube sensor, ordering the next PCB through Oshpark, and acquiring more ESP32s
        - Continue debugging PCB
        - Create 3D print of tube for dust sensor
