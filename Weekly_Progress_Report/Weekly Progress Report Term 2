# COATL-AIRCRAFT Week 1 Progress Report
Week 1 Dates: 03/31/2025 - 04/06/2025


- ## Last Week (Times in Hours)
    - Team Review
        - For our first week, we reconvened and talked about the progress of the PCB
        - Getting code to work on the PCB has been a challenge. The ESP32 on our PCB has not been responding as predicted and we cannot get proper measurements from our PCB circuit
        - We are also working on getting our MAX1032 to respond to our code. Progress has been very uneven
        - An electrode mesh for the tube dust sensor has been selected and we are waiting to talk to Josh about it's viability as an electrode mesh
